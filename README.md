Dashboard App docs: https://docs.saleor.io/docs/dashboard/apps
Dev App docs: https://docs.saleor.io/docs/developer/extending/apps

## Disclaimer

This is not official Saleor project.
Treat this project more as proof of concept, there are no security checks on webhooks and rest of the app is not tested to be released on production.

## Installation

0. You'll need [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to install dependencies.

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

1. In App directory create file `.env.local` containing:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN=https://your.app.url
SECRET=secret-which-should-be-a-secret
```

2. Configure Saleor URL

## How to add app to Saleor?

You can use https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel  or ngrok to expose your app.


1. Start App dev server

`$ yarn dev`

2. Run `appInstall` mutation from graphql client (MANAGE_APPS permission required!)

```
mutation {
  appInstall(
    input: {
      appName: "Best App"
      manifestUrl: "https://your.app.url"
      permissions: [MANAGE_PRODUCTS]
    }
  ) {
    appInstallation {
      id
      status
      appName
      manifestUrl
    }
    appErrors {
      field
      message
      code
      permissions
    }
  }
}
```

3. That's it! ðŸ¦„
